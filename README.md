Plant Disease Detection System ðŸŒ±
This repository presents a machine learning-based solution for detecting plant diseases, specifically designed for Indian crops. The system uses computer vision and deep learning techniques to identify plant diseases from images and provides actionable recommendations for treatment and prevention. It leverages localized data to ensure relevance and accuracy, making it an effective tool for Indian farmers.

The project is structured into multiple modules, including data preprocessing, model training, and deployment. Image preprocessing involves techniques like resizing, augmentation, and normalization to enhance model performance. The machine learning models, primarily based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning, are trained for high accuracy in disease classification. The deployment module makes the application accessible via a mobile app or web interface, with multilingual support to cater to Indian farmers in regional languages.

The repository includes scripts for training and testing the model, along with a backend developed using Flask or FastAPI for serving predictions. The front end (optional) can be implemented using React Native for a mobile-friendly experience. To get started, clone the repository, install dependencies, and download a dataset like PlantVillage or collect custom data from local farms.

This project utilizes tools like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV for machine learning and image processing, alongside cloud platforms like AWS or GCP for deployment. Future enhancements include expanding the system to cover more crops and diseases, integrating regional weather data for better predictions, and exploring drone-based large-scale image collection. Contributions are welcome, and detailed guidelines for collaboration are included in the repository. This system aims to empower farmers with timely disease management, reduce crop losses, and promote sustainable agricultural practices in India.

The plant disease detection model is built using advanced deep learning techniques, primarily leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for their efficiency in image classification tasks. The model uses a pre-trained architecture, such as ResNet or EfficientNet, to benefit from transfer learning, enabling faster training and improved accuracy even with limited data. Input images of plant leaves are resized, normalized, and subjected to data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotation, and brightness adjustments to enhance dataset diversity and reduce overfitting. The training process involves optimizing a categorical cross-entropy loss function using the Adam optimizer, with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score used to evaluate performance.

The model achieves high accuracy, often exceeding 90%, and is designed for scalability, allowing the inclusion of more crops and diseases in the future. It is optimized for deployment on mobile and web platforms, ensuring real-time predictions with low latency. Unique to this model is its localized focus on Indian crops and real-world validation with field images, making it highly relevant and robust for practical use. Additionally, its adaptability for continuous learning ensures long-term effectiveness as agricultural challenges evolve.
